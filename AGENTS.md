# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before responding to ANY user message, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, install it via npm: `npm install -g compose-agentsmd`.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# GHWS workspace repository management

- Apply these rules only when the repository path is under the ghws workspace root; ignore this module for standalone clones outside ghws.
- All folders in this workspace (except `agent-rules-local`) are Git repositories connected to GitHub.
- Some repositories are not owned by the user, but the user can commit and push to them.
- If the target repository already exists under the current `ghws` workspace, edit it in place.
- If the target repository is not present under the current `ghws` workspace, clone it from GitHub with `--recursive` and then work in the cloned folder.
- When adding a new repository, create it under the `ghws` workspace first and then push it to GitHub.
- For account-wide requests, treat all user-owned repositories as in scope; repository creation, splitting, and deletion are allowed when needed.
- Never clone repositories that are not managed by the user into the `ghws` workspace.

# High-quality OpenCode workflow

- Repository-local OpenCode workflows MUST live in `.opencode/commands/`.
- The canonical verification command MUST be the same command used for local validation before delivery.
- When no canonical verification command is configured, the agent MUST stop and report the missing bootstrap requirement instead of inventing a partial substitute.
- Bug fixes MUST add or strengthen a regression check before concluding.
- Irreversible operations such as destructive deletion, publish, release, force-push, or external side effects MUST remain approval-gated.
